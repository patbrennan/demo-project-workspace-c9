# A Mark-Down file...

This is a simple markdown file. It ~~can~~ include a lot of things. There is no real limit to what it can or cannot include.

Markdown file formats can be used to render HTML automatically through the `redcarpet` gem. Just `gem "redcarpet"` in your Gemfile, `bundle install`, then `require "redcarpet"` in your code.

```
def be_badass(person)
  name = person
  puts "#{name} is a badass!"
end
```
