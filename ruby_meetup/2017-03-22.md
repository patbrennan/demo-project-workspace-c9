Read: Controller / Model / View (MVC)


blog.codeclimate.com - read: 7 patterns to refactor fat activerecord models

1. Service Objects: class named verb, does 1 thing. 
2. Extract Form Objects 
3. Extract Query Objects
4. Extract Decorators (Library - Draper)
5. Extract Policy Objects (two ways to remove all helpers from a Rails app (other is Decorators)). These are testable in isolation (not needing to load your app)
NOTE: Should never have to test the views.

*Using standard Ruby is possible & sometimes better than Rails, but look for libraries / gems that will help you.
